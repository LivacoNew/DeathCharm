# Death Charm
A incredibly simple NeoForge mod that adds a reasonable middle-ground to the Keep Inventory debate. It adds a Death Charm (funnily enough) that has a limited number of uses before it must be re-created.

By default it has 3 uses before it is destroyed (configurable). When you die, it uses up a use and restores your items upon respawn.
